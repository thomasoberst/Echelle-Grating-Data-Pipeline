# Echelle-Grating-Data-Pipeline
(LabVIEW) A data acquisition and reduction pipeline for a 32-channel echelle grating spectrometer. Originally used for observations of high-redshift galaxies from the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope atop Mauna Kea, Hawaii. PDF snapshot(s) included for non-LabVIEW users. I’m still tracking down and converting all the original source files. Coming soon…
